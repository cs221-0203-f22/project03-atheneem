# MiniMax

This project uses recursive backtracking for the computer to accurately pick the next best possible move in order for it to win in a game of tic-tac-toe.

This project has two different uses

USE 1: Through command line arguemnts, the user plays as X and gives the Tic=-ac-Toe board filled positions with X and Os and use question marks to represent a blank space. The computer will then compute the next best possible move for O to play in order for it to win or at the very least tie

USE2: Through the command line, the user plays as X and gives the one position it wants to start off as. The computer will continuously play back and forth with the user and attempt to win.
